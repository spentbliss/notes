# Intense 3-Month Core Computer Science Roadmap

Goal: Build solid, practical core CS knowledge to confidently solve problems and
pivot into most tech fields.  
Time commitment: ~6 hours/day, 7 days/week (~42 hrs/week)  
All resources are FREE.

# A learning approach I love is iterative learning
learn → apply → reflect → learn next topic → &repeat

Weekly Topics & Projects:

Week 1:  
- Learn C basics: variables, control flow, pointers, functions  
- Project: Number guessing game

Week 2:  
- Explore C memory management: malloc/free, structs, file I/O  
- Project: Build a mini text file parser or a simple command-line to-do list

Week 3:  
- Learn Python basics: data types, object-oriented programming, error handling, scripting  
- Project: Automate a daily task such as file renaming or web scraping

Supplement: Big-O Notation Primer  
https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/

Weekly Topics & Projects:

Week 4:  
- Study arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashing  
- Learn time complexity concepts (Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega) and how to analyze algorithms  
- Solve a few targeted, beginner-friendly coding problems to apply these concepts  
- Project: Implement these basic data structures in C or Python

Week 5:  
- Study trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, recursion  
- Practice analyzing algorithm efficiency and compare different sorting methods  
- Solve a few relevant problems focusing on these topics (not memorizing solutions)  
- Project: Visualize sorting algorithms or graph traversals

Tip: Focus on understanding problem-solving patterns, not on memorizing code.

Week 11:  
- Learn routing, congestion control, and security basics  
- Project: Extend your chat app with basic authentication features

---

6. Capstone Projects & Review  
Timeline: 1 week

- Build a project combining multiple topics (e.g., a mini HTTP server in C  
  handling multiple connections, or a file sync tool using sockets)  
- Review and strengthen weak areas  
- Prepare notes and summaries for future reference

Tips for Success

- Spend ~2 hours daily on reading and conceptual learning  
- Spend ~2 hours daily coding and building projects  
- Spend ~1.5 hours daily reviewing and refactoring code  
- Spend ~0.5 hours reflecting on progress and planning the next day  
- Build projects that progressively challenge you to boost confidence  
- Use Google, Stack Overflow, and forums liberally — learning to find answers  
  is a key skill  
- Track progress and write key takeaways weekly
