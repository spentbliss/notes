# LEARNING THE PROTOCOLS THAT RUN THE INTERNET

To build a strong foundation in networking and understand the protocols
that the internet runs on, it's important to learn them in a logical order.
Starting from the most fundamental protocols to more application-specific ones:

## PROTOCOLS TO LEARN

1. **Internet Protocol (IP)**
   - **IPv4**: RFC 791
   - **IPv6**: RFC 8200
   - Understanding IP is crucial as it is the primary protocol for routing
     packets across networks.

2. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**
    - RFC: 793
     - TCP is essential for understanding how reliable communication is
     established over IP.

3. **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**
   - RFC: 768
   - Learn about UDP to understand connectionless communication and its use cases.

4. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
   - RFC: RFC 5246 (TLS 1.2) and RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3)
   - Importance: Provides secure communication over a computer network, widely
     used to secure web traffic (HTTPS), email, and other protocols.

5. **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**
   - RFC: 792
   - ICMP is important for network diagnostics and error reporting.

6. **Domain Name System (DNS)**
   - RFC: 1035
   - DNS is critical for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

7. **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**
   - RFC: 2131
   - DHCP is used for dynamically assigning IP addresses to devices on a network.

8. **Network Time Protocol (NTP)**
   - RFC: 5905
   - NTP is important for synchronizing clocks across devices in a network.

9. **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**
   - RFC: 959
   - FTP is a foundational protocol for transferring files over the internet.

10. **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
   - RFC: 7230 (HTTP/1.1)
   - HTTP is the protocol used for transferring web pages.

11. **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**
    - RFC: 2818 (HTTP over TLS)
    - Understanding HTTPS is crucial for secure web communication.

12. **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**
    - RFC: 5321
    - SMTP is the standard protocol for sending emails.

13. **Post Office Protocol (POP3)**
    - RFC: 1939
    - POP3 is used for retrieving emails from a server.

14. **Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)**
    - RFC: 3501
    - IMAP is another protocol for retrieving emails, with more features than POP3.

15. **Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)**
    - RFC: 2045
    - MIME is important for understanding how emails can include different types
      of content.

16. **Secure Shell (SSH)**
    - RFC: 4251
    - SSH is essential for secure remote administration and file transfers.

17. **Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)**
    - RFC: 3550
    - RTP is used for delivering audio and video over IP networks.

18. **Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)**
    - RFC: 3261
    - SIP is used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time sessions.

19. **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**
    - RFC: 4511
    - LDAP is used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information
      services.

20. **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)**
    - RFC: 1157
    - SNMP is used for network management and monitoring.

21. **WebSocket**
    - RFC: 6455
    - WebSocket is important for real-time communication between clients and servers.

22. **Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)**
    - While not listed, RTCP is often paired with RTP and is worth understanding
      for managing RTP sessions.

# INTERESTING PROTOCOLS

**Cisco Systems Netflow Services**
  - RFC: 3954
  - NetFlow is used for collecting and monitoring network traffic data.
